### Short Story: 
You are a shadow named Shadow. Your task is fighting your way through a hell like world to regain your abilities and get your body back. You will fight through several enemy types and mini-bosses that are there to stop you from gaining your abilities. Each time you complete a level, your body will slowly come back, and you will gain a new ability. At the final level, you will face the Fallen Hero, who is the main boss who took your body. Traverse through this 2d Platformer and help Shadow get his body back.
